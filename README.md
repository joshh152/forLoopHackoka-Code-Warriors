#The project aims to stop people from purchasing stolen cars.
In order to prevent people from purchasing stolen cars. We developed a portal where people can register their cars and inform the general public about the status of his/her car (Status include "Available, Stolen and For Sale").

To register a car on the platform, you need to be a registered member.
Upon registration, only the registered memeber can change the status of a car.

We use the chassis number or the plate number of the car to search the database and and return the current status of the car.


#Future Plans.
1. Authenticate registers (with the use of the mvrd database created by Prosper Otemuyiwa)
2. Ability to report stolen cars


#Limitations
1. Lack of a general database from which users can be authenticated
